# tanklets

This is a multiplayer tank game I am making using Go. No game engine, just [Go bindings to OpenGL](https://github.com/go-gl), GLFW, my [port of Chipmunk2D](https://github.com/jakecoffman/cp), and [Nuklear for GUI stuff](https://github.com/golang-ui/nuklear).

The original Unity version is [here](https://github.com/jakecoffman/tanks-unity).

## how to play

1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/jakecoffman/tanklets/releases/latest)
1. Download `bins.zip`
1. Extract it
1. Run `tanklets.exe` (windows) or `tanklets.app` (mac)
1. Click Host & Join to start a LAN game, or Play Now to try your luck online
